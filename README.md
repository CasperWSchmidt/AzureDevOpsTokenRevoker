# AzureDevOpsTokenRevoker
Automated revokation of all tokens created in Azure DevOps. Runs using Selenium (ChromeDriver) in the background (minimized window) so you can spend your precious time on something more important!

Idea came when SourceTree/Git Credentials Manager messed up and created thousands of tokens on my account instead of saving/reusing active tokens already created.
